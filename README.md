# dijkstra-chessformer-solver
Algorithm in C based on Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm to solve Chessformer. Includes my report analysing the complexity of the algorithm.

Chessformer is a puzzle game inspired by Chess. The game combines traditional Chess piece movements with a unique twist: after each move, pieces fall to the nearest platform. The objective is to strategically navigate the player piece to capture all target pieces in each puzzle.

My algorithm can be found within ai.c while the skeleton code has been supplied by UniMelbâ€™s 2024 Sem 2 COMP20003 teaching team.
